      Hey you<br><br>

      I know things havenâ€™t been easy to decide<br>
      I know your heart has its reasons and its fears<br><br>

      But I want you to know this<br>
      Iâ€™m not rushing you<br>
      Iâ€™m not trying to push you<br><br>

      Iâ€™m just hereâ€¦ patiently, gently, honestly<br>
      Waiting for the moment when youâ€™re ready<br>
      Not because I need an answer now<br>
      But because I already know what I feel<br><br>

      You matter to me more than you can imagine<br>
      Your voice, your eyes, the way you laugh<br>
      The way you care even when youâ€™re scared<br><br>

      Iâ€™ve thought about this a lot<br>
      And I wanted to find the most sincere way to ask<br><br>

      Not with pressure<br>
      Not with expectations<br>
      Just with my heart<br><br>

      Soâ€¦ when you're ready to decide<br>
      Iâ€™ll be right here, waiting with open arms
