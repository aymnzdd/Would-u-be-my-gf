      Hey you<br><br>
      I know things haven’t been easy to decide<br>
      I know your heart has its reasons and its fears<br><br>
      But I want you to know this<br>
      I’m not rushing you<br>
      I’m not trying to push you<br><br>
      I’m just here… patiently, gently, honestly<br>
      Waiting for the moment when you’re ready<br>
      Not because I need an answer now<br>
      But because I already know what I feel<br><br>
      You matter to me more than you can imagine<br>
      Your voice, your eyes, the way you laugh<br>
      The way you care even when you’re scared<br><br>
      I’ve thought about this a lot<br>
      And I wanted to find the most sincere way to ask<br><br>
      Not with pressure<br>
      Not with expectations<br>
      Just with my heart<br><br>
      So… when you're ready to decide<br>
      I’ll be right here, waiting with open arms

          I know your heart has been hurt before<br>
          And I know that choosing to open it again isn’t easy<br><br>
          But I want you to know — I see you<br>
          All of you<br>
          Not just the parts that smile and shine<br>
          But also the parts that doubt, that fear, that hesitate<br>
          And I don’t love you any less for them<br>
          In fact, I love you more<br><br>
          You don’t need to be perfect to be loved<br>
          You don’t need to be ready to be held<br>
          You just need to be real — and you already are<br><br>
          So if your answer is “I need time”<br>
          Then I’ll give you all the time in the world<br>
          Not because I’m weak<br>
          But because I’m strong enough to wait<br>
          For you. Only you<br><br>
          I’m not going anywhere<br>
          Not today, not tomorrow, not ever<br>
          I’m not here just for the easy days<br>
          I’m here for your questions, your confusion, your quiet nights and your tired mornings<br>
          I’m here for the version of you that’s still learning to trust again<br><br>
          And while you think, while you wonder, while you search your heart<br>
          Please remember this — I am not your past<br>
          I’m not the one who broke you<br>
          I’m the one who wants to help you heal<br><br>
          I want to be your peace, not your pressure<br>
          Your calm, not your chaos<br>
          I want to build a love with you that feels like safety and home<br><br>
          So take your time, love<br>
          As much as you need<br>
          Just know that when you're ready to fall<br>
          I’ll be here — with arms wide open and a heart that’s already yours<br>
          Quietly, patiently, faithfully<br>
          Waiting to write something beautiful… with you
